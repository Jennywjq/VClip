## 🚀 How to Run

### 🧠 Stage 1: Audio Transcription

This stage is executed by the transcription.py script.


‼️Core Task: It uses the Whisper model to transcribe audio from a video file.


📌 Note: Please manually update the video path inside the script or provide it as input.


🎯 What it does:
Extracts audio from your video
Transcribes the audio using Whisper
Generates a timestamped transcript stored in the output/ folder


📝 Output: A structured .json file with accurate timestamps and corresponding transcribed text.


```bash
python transcription.py
```

---


### 🧠 Stage 2: Initial Segmentation 

This stage is executed by the segment_text.py script.



‼️Core Task: It reads the transcript from Stage 1 and uses the DeepSeek model to segment it into logical and semantically meaningful paragraphs.


📌 Note:Set up your own DeepSeek API key. Modify the script to include your API configuration.


📝 Output: JSON output showing how many segments were created, including start and end timestamps for each paragraph.


```bash
python segment_text.py
```
