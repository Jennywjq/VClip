Video & Audio Extraction

VideoExtract.py
This script performs initial preprocessing on raw video files by extracting:

One frame per second as .jpg images

The full audio track in high-quality .wav format

This provides essential input data for downstream multimodal analysis such as visual scoring, ASR transcription, and scene segmentation.
